mimoLive_Tally.html

We made a standalone HTML/Javascript Tally Light to use for interview partners to show them if the camera is live for them. It’s coded as a standalone HTML/Javascript page, so it can be used on most devices. mimoLive Server Address and API Endpoint can be entered via a form or hardcoded into the javascript code. The Tally light will show the name of the source, green if it’s in preview mode and red if live. Use the code on your own risk!
