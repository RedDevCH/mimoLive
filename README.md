Hardware $35 DIY Tally Light for mimoLive to signal audio and/or video is live. Hardware components are based on the easy to get Arduino plattform. Code can be adapted to other Arduino-based CPU types and signalling boards. Use the code on your own risk!

We made a standalone HTML/Javascript Tally Light to use for interview partners to show them if the camera is live for them. It’s coded as a standalone HTML/Javascript page, so it can be used on most devices. mimoLive Server Address and API Endpoint can be entered via a form or hardcoded into the javascript code. The Tally light will show the name of the source, green if it’s in preview mode and red if live. Use the code on your own risk!
